Chat Room using Remote Method Invocation

The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is an API that provides a mechanism to create distributed application in java. The RMI allows an object to invoke methods on an object running in another JVM.

The RMI provides remote communication between the applications using two objects *stub* and *skeleton*.

RMI uses stub and skeleton object for communication with the remote object.

A **remote object** is an object whose method can be invoked from another JVM.
